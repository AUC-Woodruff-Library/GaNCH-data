# GaNCH

Using Linked Open Data for Georgia's Natural, Cultural, and Historic Organizations' Disaster Response.

The [Atlanta University Center Robert W. Woodruff Library](https://www.auctr.edu/) would like to gratefully acknolwedge [LYRASIS](https://www.lyrasis.org/Pages/Main.aspx) for their support of this project via a [2019 LYRASIS Catalyst Fund grant](https://lyrasisnow.org/press-release-lyrasis-announces-the-2019-catalyst-fund-recipients-and-their-projects/)

This one-year project will create a publicly editable directory of Georgia’s Natural, Cultural and Historical Organizations (NCHs), allowing for quick retrieval of location and contact information for disaster response. Directory information will be compiled, updated, and uploaded to Wikidata, the linked open data database from the Wikimedia Foundation. Directory information will then be delivered via a website, allowing emergency responders to quickly search for NCHs in disaster areas. A website will be created that can display embedded subsets of the directory for emergency responders.

### Workflow

* Compile (Jul – Sep, 2019). Graduate Student Assistant (GSA) will use existing data lists (such as the Directory of Historical and Cultural Organizations) as a starting point. Data will be reformatted into a spreadsheet.
* Update (Oct – Dec, 2019). GSA will use web, email, and phone research to confirm that the data is correct and add any updates as necessary.
* Source (Oct – Dec, 2019). Each item will be sourced with references to allow for verification of the updates.
* Reconcile (Jan, 2020). Using OpenRefine, the spreadsheet will be reconciled against Wikidata’s schema.
* Upload (Feb, 2020). Updates will be uploaded to Wikidata.
* Access (Feb - Apr, 2020). Web Developer will create a website to display results at the City, County, and State level.
* Maintain (Mar – May, 2020). Web Developer will create an automated process to email NCHs annually to request updates. Partner organizations (see below) will assist in annual updates.
* Promote (Apr – Jun, 2020). Partner organizations have expressed an interest in providing outreach to NCHs.
