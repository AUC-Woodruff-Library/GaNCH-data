# 2020-04-20 Emergency Responders / Coordinators Focus Group

Prompt:
How do you currently gather NCH organization location and contact information, and how do you use that information when responding to a disaster?

HERA: Last time we tried to use the data, it was in the GHRAC database, and it was out of date.  Used post-disaster to follow up with institutions.  Could see value in reaching out ahead of time.

GEMA: Rely on HERA or SHER, which doesn't encompass all 159 counties.  Work wtih DNR historic Preservation Division, talk with their staff. They're focused on state parks and other pre-ientified historic preservation designees. This project (GaNCH) is helping to raise situational awareness pre- and post-incident.  Also receieve info from state emergency managers or GEMA area coordinators. Don't have one direct place to get a picture of the entire state.

SHER: Affiliate of Coastal Museums Assoc. Gave membership list to CEMA (Chatham Emergency Management Agency), which includes org, physical address, primary and secondary contacts, and cell numbers for emergencies.  Most agencies have 1 or 2 emergency contacts.  CEMA has built a dashboard in WebEOC (emergency operations center software) that lists those agencies.  Glenda has access to sign in. Goal is to be able to have agencies load their own info into the WebEOC.  Have an email listserv and Facebook page to help spread the word. Organizations adding photos to Facebook doesn't mean that it gets into the WebEOC to get emergency declarations and financial aid.  Rely on folks posting to the listserv and posting to SHER's Facebook.  If it's on Facebook, someone has to get the photos and put them into WebEOC.  SHER/CEMA only covers Chatham County, but Coastal Museums Assoc. is up and down the coast.  If we can make EMAG aware that GaNCH exists, then they can download the entities for their county to reach out.

Tim Head creates the WebEOC for the state level.  He couldn't attend but is interested in attending.  EMAG has two conferences each year to get the word out.
