# 2020-04-20 Emergency Responders / Coordinators Focus Group

Prompt:
How do you currently gather NCH organization location and contact information, and how do you use that information when responding to a disaster?

HERA: Last time we tried to use the data, it was in the GHRAC database, and it was out of date.  Used post-disaster to follow up with institutions.  Could see value in reaching out ahead of time.

GEMA: Rely on HERA or SHER, which doesn't encompass all 159 counties.  Work wtih DNR historic Preservation Division, talk with their staff. They're focused on state parks and other pre-ientified historic preservation designees. This project (GaNCH) is helping to raise situational awareness pre- and post-incident.  Also receieve info from state emergency managers or GEMA area coordinators. Don't have one direct place to get a picture of the entire state.

SHER: Affiliate of Coastal Museums Assoc. Gave membership list to CEMA (Chatham Emergency Management Agency), which includes org, physical address, primary and secondary contacts, and cell numbers for emergencies.  Most agencies have 1 or 2 emergency contacts.  CEMA has built a dashboard in WebEOC (emergency operations center software) that lists those agencies.  Glenda has access to sign in. Goal is to be able to have agencies load their own info into the WebEOC.  Have an email listserv and Facebook page to help spread the word. Organizations adding photos to Facebook doesn't mean that it gets into the WebEOC to get emergency declarations and financial aid.  Rely on folks posting to the listserv and posting to SHER's Facebook.  If it's on Facebook, someone has to get the photos and put them into WebEOC.  SHER/CEMA only covers Chatham County, but Coastal Museums Assoc. is up and down the coast.  If we can make EMAG aware that GaNCH exists, then they can download the entities for their county to reach out.

GEMA: Tim Head creates the WebEOC for the state level.  He couldn't attend but is interested in attending.  EMAG has two conferences each year to get the word out.  We often only get two points of contact, but sometimes those two contacts aren't available.  It would be useful to try to get four points of contact for each organization (folks who are part of the Contitutity of Business Plan).  People who have decision-making authority.

SHER: Need cell phone contacts, not just email.

GaNCH: Although we're not gathering private information, we can at least get the word out as we advertise the project.  

GEMA: Send to Lamar Mcewen -- State Operations Center Coordinator; Tim Head -- WebEOC Guru; Sherri Ruso - GEMA Homeland Security Coordinator

Prompt: 
Map

GEMA: Will each dot have more information about what's at that location?

Prompt: 
Table

GEMA: Need GEMA regions. Need to show county.   It would be good to add website, social media, and type of institution.  When marketing, it's important to capture the parent organizations in order to get the designation (in order to secure funding sources -- owned by city, county, state, federal, private, non-profit, for-profit, affiliated with a school system)

GaNCH: Want to empower anyone to edit their own Wikidata page entries, so that they don't have to wait

GEMA: Possible to organize by institution type?

GaNCH: Not building that in right now.

GEMA: Would like to have lists of hazardous materials on site (for fire response), and floor plans.  May need to have that given to the WebEOC side, rather than publically visible site.
